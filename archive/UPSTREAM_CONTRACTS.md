# Upstream contract verification (archived context)

This repository is an experimental fork of `succinctlabs/op-succinct` focused on exploring a ZisK-based proving stack.

The upstream project includes a production-oriented end-to-end system that integrates Solidity contracts for verifying proofs and posting outputs on-chain.

This fork **does not** target on-chain proof verification as an end goal. The `contracts/` directory remains in the repository primarily for reference and compatibility with upstream structure.
